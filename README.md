# Bank-Database-Project (In Progress)

The enterprise is Nickel Savings and Loan, a fictional bank that is approximately half as good as the New York-based Dime Community Bank. For this project, we shall focus only on the financial aspects of the bank, and not details regarding bank employees, physical locations, etc. We shall focus on retail customers who have accounts, loans, debit cards, and credit cards, and not corporate customers. The financial aspects we shall consider are only those that relate directly to customers, not such matters as tax reporting.

The project is an end-to-end design and implementation project in which I model part of an enterprises databases for a Bank, create the database using SQL (on Oracle or PostgreSQL), populate it with data, and use JDBC to implement several simple user interfaces to the database.

There are several steps to this project.
- ER design
- Relational schema
- Data generation and population of relations
- Interface coding

Tools used: SQL (Oracle SQL Developer 19.2.1, JDBC, PL/SQL)
